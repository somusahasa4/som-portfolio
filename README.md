# Som Profile

This portfolio was created using  [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Also included [React Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) and [scss] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/scss) for UI.

## Available Scripts

It also lint errors in the console.

### `npm deploy`

Deploys the latest code to Github pages. To do this, there is a github branch called 'gh-pages' in the repository. 'main' branch keeps the source code and 'gh-pages' keeps the build files.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
